# Iris-Species-Classifier  
This is a simple iris classifier using knn model from sci-kit learn. This is an introductory practice to machine learning.  
  
**Learning Outcomes:**
- Build a Machine Learning Model (KNN) to predict iris species given: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width (in cm)
- Explore introductory concepts to machine learning e.g dataset exploration,model fitting, train split, get accuracy score (model performance)
